## About Me
### *As a Programmer*
I am a programmer with two years of experience in programming. I have learned several programming languages, including JAVA, C, C++, and R. While I have more experience in back-end development, **I am interested in exploring _front-end_ development as well.** ***Currently, I am looking to collaborate with others on a project this quarter***.

### As a Person
My name is **Wenyu Zhong**, and I'm a senior majoring in Math-CS. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and photography. Recently, I went on a road trip to visit five national parks and went hiking during Spring Break.
My favorite quote:
> Never look back.
